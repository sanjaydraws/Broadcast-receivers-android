Broadcast receivers - app Component and this can listen different events(wifi connectivity changes, when get sms)
===================  can send broadcast to our own apps
android can receive and send broadcast messages from the android system and the other android apps



Delivering a Broadcast

A broadcast is a message that any app can receive. In android,
 the system delivers various broadcast system events like device starts charging, disable or enable airplane mode, etc.

intent -
The intent is a messaging object which tells what kind of action to be performed.
The intentâ€™s most significant use is the launching of the activity

explicit intent - > In explicit intent user knows about all the things like after clicking a button which activity will start and Explicit intents are used for communication inside the application
implicit intent ->which allows a component from another app to handle.when you tap the share button in any app you can see the Gmail, Bluetooth, and other sharing app options.

intent filter ->

implicit intent uses the intent filter to serve the user request
The intent filter specifies the types of intents that an activity, service, or broadcast receiver can respond.


/* when system  events defined in manifest happens(another entry point for app)
  brodcast triggerred, onReceive() will happen -- implicit broadcast

  static -> to define broadcast reciver in manifest, even if app is not currently running, that listen implicit broadcast
  Conectivty changes -> api level more than 24 not if define in manifest (because low memory )
   not working after 25 if register in manifest because battery low

  explicit broadcast receivers - calling directly by class name

=========================
 for dynamic receiver -> don't need to define in mainfest,define java class in context of our application
 and broadcast receiver only will live as long as where register on
 particular  context. so the app can listen event when app is running in background if stops can't listen

 * want to keep active in even app in background  register on onCreate and  unregister on onDestroy
 * this would keep broadcast receiver live of the lifecycle of activity
 *
 * if want to active whole app is running register in onCreate of application class



 ========================================================

implicit Br -> app and android system itself send a broadcast with action string
               and any broadcast receivers that wants to receive that broadcast has to register this particualr string
               with an intent filter

               since oreo most of these implicit broadcast receivers only works if we register them dynamically
               and the lifecycle of our app which means in order to receive this broadcast our app has already  be running

               before we could also register this broadcast receiver in manifest file statically ,this way receive them even if our app is not running
               in which case system would starts our app , only for reacting to broadcast
               (But this limitation will not apply to explicit broadcast receivers)

explicit Br-> doesn't define action,specified broadcast receiver directly that want to trigger
             this broadcast receiver can be our own app and another app


Custom Br -> for just listening system broadcast we can also send and receive our very own broadcast
            this can be explicit broadcast(means specified a component that we want to trigger directly so no other br will trigger)
            or can send implicit br  which is same as the system br where we just define action
            then ever br wants to receive this br we have to set intent filter with the same
            action on it
