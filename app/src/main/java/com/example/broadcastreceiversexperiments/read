Broadcast receivers
===================
broadcast receivers helps our app in communicating with android os an other apps 


android can receive and send broadcast messages from the android system and the other android apps
// register in manifest
/* when system  events defined in manifest happens(another entry point for app)
  brodcast triggerred, onReceive() will happen -- implicit broadcast

  static -> to define broadcast reciver in manifest, even if app is not currently running




  explicit broadcast receivers - calling directly by class name


=========================================================
 for dynamic receiver -> don't need to define in mainfest

// if want broadcast receiver active as long as whole app is running -  register broadcast receiver in  onCreate of Application class
    // if  want broadcast receive active in background - register broadcast receiver in on create and unregister on onDestroy - keep active lifecycle of activity
